## Overview
This project analyzes water dynamics in the coastal region of Venice, Italy, using NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) calculations. It highlights the significant increase in water coverage over the years, even during periods of low water levels, emphasizing the impact of environmental and climatic changes on this vital region.

The key objectives of the study are:
1. To quantify water area changes between 2021 and 2024.
2. To analyze deviations below and above yearly average water areas.
3. To identify patterns and trends in minimum and maximum water levels.
